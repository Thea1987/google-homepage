Copy of google homepage website. The objectif of this exercise is to build my first website and make it look like the google website without it fucnitioning like so. Through this exercise i learnt to:
-build a horizontal nav bar
-find the url or images to re-create the icons
-practice the theory learnt till now concerning: divs, classes, id's, forms, buttons, basic HTML and CSS 
-use google to search when i was stuck
-use github to share my work 
-* i still need to learn to make a footer that sticks to the bottom of the page and align the icons so it looks nice.
