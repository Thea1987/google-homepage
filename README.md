Copy of google homepage website. The objectif of this exercise is to build my first website and make it look like the google website without it necessarily fucnitioning like so. Through this exercise i learnt to:
-build a horizontal nav bar
-find the url or images to re-create the icons
-build my own button to re-create a logo
-practice the theory learnt till now concerning: divs, classes, id's, forms, buttons, basic HTML and CSS 
-use google to search when i was stuck
-use github to share my work 
-*I don't understand why my account logo is black and not white as specified by the CSS
